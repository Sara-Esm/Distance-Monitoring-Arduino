# Distance Monitoring System with LED Feedback (Arduino)

The Distance Monitoring System with LED Feedback is an Arduino-based project that utilizes ultrasonic sensors, LEDs, and an LCD display to create a real-time distance measurement and visual feedback system. This project showcases the practical application of Arduino in creating an interactive and accurate distance monitoring system.

## Features

- Real-time distance measurement using ultrasonic sensors
- LED feedback for visual indication of distance levels
- LCD display for displaying distance readings
- Adjustable threshold for triggering LED feedback
- User-friendly interface for easy interaction

## Components

- Arduino Uno board: Acts as the microcontroller and central processing unit of the project.
- Ultrasonic Range Measurement Module HC-SR04: Measures distance using ultrasonic waves.
- LEDs: Provides visual feedback based on the distance measured.
- 2x16 LCD display: Displays the distance readings.
- Jumper wires: Used for connecting the components together.

## Installation

1. Connect the Ultrasonic Range Measurement Module HC-SR04 to the Arduino Uno board.
2. Connect the LEDs to the appropriate pins on the Arduino Uno board.
3. Connect the 2x16 LCD display to the Arduino Uno board.
4. Upload the provided Arduino code to the Arduino Uno board.

## Usage

1. Power on the Arduino-based system.
2. The ultrasonic sensors will measure the distance to the nearest obstacle.
3. The LCD display will show the distance reading in real-time.
4. The LEDs will provide visual feedback based on the distance measured, indicating proximity.
5. Adjust the threshold in the Arduino code if necessary to customize the LED feedback based on your requirements.

## Customization

- Modify the Arduino code to adjust the LED threshold values for different distance ranges.
- Customize the pin assignments and wiring based on your specific components and requirements.
